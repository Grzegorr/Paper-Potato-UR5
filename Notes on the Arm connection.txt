IP setup:

There is 4 places wher IP goes in:
1.kg_client (the progeam on the pendant)
2."network" console on the pendant
3.kg_robot in the code
4. controller code

There are 2 IPs which are used. First is computer ethernet IP - open cmand and do ipconfing, carefull to use ethernet not wifi IP. 
This addres goes into kg_robot(3) and into kg_client(1). The rest two need to be filled with an IP which has last bit changed.
